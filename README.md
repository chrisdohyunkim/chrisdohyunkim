📊 I’m a recent MBA grad with a concentration in data analysis, interested in a career in full stack development and data engineering.

👀 Currently diving headfirst into the world of full-stack development—self-taught, fueled by curiosity (and a lot of coffee ☕).

Always up for collaborating on projects, learning new tech, and sharing ideas!
