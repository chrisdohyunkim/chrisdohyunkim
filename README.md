I’m a MBA grad with a concentration in data analysis, interested in a career in full stack development and data engineering.

Through my self-taught journey in full stack development and data engineering, I am hoping to gain the technical skills to build end-to-end solutions, from designing intuitive applications to managing and analyzing large datasets. The combination of business insight from my previous experiences and technical capability empowers me to contribute meaningfully to projects that require both analytical rigor and hands-on implementation.

Excited to collaborate on projects, learn new tech, and share ideas with others!
